## Assessment of README
- Poor formatting, unreadable in some sections
- No general structure for the document
- Good documentation for completed and future stories
- Could include a contributing guide: ex how to run the emulator with the app
- Link to guides for all the different technologies used
- No screenshots of the app included

## Assessment of build.gradle
- Fairly standard build.gradle, easy to understand if you are familiar with gradle
- Maybe add more comments so that new contributors can easily contribute

## Assessment of issues
- Several clear issues have been identified and it should be easy to earn 1000 points

## Additional issues
to be added

## Assessment of code
do it later

## Assessment of test
= There are no tests at all. 
- We will be heavily unit testing any existing or additional methods we create.
- We will first analyze the code and refactor any functions if necessary. 
- Then we will add unit tests for those methods, constatly adding tests for every PR we make.
