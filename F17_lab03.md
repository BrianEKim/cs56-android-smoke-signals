## Project Description
This application allows you to remotely control your device and get information about it by sending and receiving SMS messages. 

## Current User Stories
- As a user, I can send an SMS with body "//Location" so that I know where my phone is.
- As a user, I can send an SMS with body "//Contact [name]" so that I can recieve information about any contacts with a name similar or equal to name. 
- As a user, I can send an SMS with body "//Battery" so that I can recieve information about the phone's battery percentage and charging status.
- As a user, I can send an SMS with body "//Calls" so that I can recieve information about last phone calls it has gotten.
- As a user, I can send an SMS with body "//Ring" so I can make my phone ring.
- As a user, I can send an SMS with body "//Help" so that I can learn about the commands avaliable.
- As a user, I can send an SMS with body "//SMS [number] m:[message]" :** Send an sms to [number] saying [message].
- As a user, I can send an SMS with body "//Joke" so I can recieve a joke. 
- As a user, I can send an SMS with body "//Wifi [arguemnt]" so that I can either get the wifi status or toggle it on and off.
- As a user, I can send an SMS with body "//Bluetooth [argument]" so that I can either get the bluetooth status or toggle it on and off.
- As a user, I can send an SMS with body "//Status [argument]" so that I can get the wifi or bluetooth status.
- As a user, I can send an SMS with body "//Powersave [function name]" to turn off a phone. 
- As a user, I can send an SMS with body "//WhiteList" that toggles whether or not the whitelist is active.
- As a user, I can add a number to the whitelist so that I can let a new a phone send commands.

## Assessment
The software mostly runs correctly. There are a few features that do not work properly: Bluetooth and Powersave did not work properly on the emulator. The other commands work as advertised and toast the user when a command has come in. It then launches a toast with the command requested and responds with an SMS containing the pertinent info or performs the appropriate action.

## Future User Stories
- As a user, I shold be able to send an SMS with body "//Apps" that sends back a list of running apps.
- As a user, I should be able to send an SMS with body "//PowerSave" that toggles battery saver mode and kills processes that are expensive.
- As a user, I should be able to add a element to the whitelist without it being added multiple times.
- As a user, I should be able to clearly add an element to the whitelist without being confused.
- As a developer, I should be able to test my code in order to verify it works.
- As a developer, I should be able to look at a JavaDoc to know what each method does.

## Assessment of README
- Poor formatting, unreadable in some sections
- No general structure for the document
- Good documentation for completed and future stories
- Could include a contributing guide: ex how to run the emulator with the app
- Link to guides for all the different technologies used
- No screenshots of the app included

## Assessment of build.gradle
- Fairly standard build.gradle, easy to understand if you are familiar with gradle
- Maybe add more comments so that new contributors aren't lost

## Assessment of issues
Several clear issues have been identified and it should be easy to earn 1000 points. See future user stories.

## Assessment of code
do it later

## Assessment of test
There are no tests at all. We will be heavily unit testing any existing or additional methods we create. We will first analyze the code and refactor any functions if necessary. Then we will add unit tests for those methods, constatly adding tests for every PR we make.
