* Issue : Fix the Ring feature, it rings for too long. 
* Issue : Implement a BlackList feature 
* Issue : Commands are too strict, make it check the substring instead. 
        For example - "//Joke " will not trigger the joke feature because it has a space after. 
* Issue : WhiteList and BlackList should have a GUI that allows users to check boxes off in a list of contacts.
* Issue : More commands that check if other services are on or off.
* Issue : Add a RemindMe feature that sets an event on the calendar
* Issue : Debugging GUI
* Issue : Tune location
* Issue : Powersave
* Issue : Snap
