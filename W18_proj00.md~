A.) Smoke Signals allows you to automate several tasks through an SMS message. Say one loses their phone, they can text their phone with another phone and the app will text back its gps location.

B.) As a user, I can text my phone from another phone to ring, and my phone will start ringing.

C.)The software does not run. The app will start up but once an SMS command comes in the app will crash.

D.)As a user, I can text my phone play music, and it will start playing music found in my music library.

As a user, I can text snap to my phone and my phone would take a picture.

E.) A little more advice would be helpful on where to start with the code or how to familiarize oneself with the code.

F.) There is no build.xml file but instead a gradle file. There are some directions to the build.gradle but not enough for someone who is new to build.gradle.

G.) There are some existing bugs, such as duplicate numbers being added to the whitelist. There is also the issue the the app does not allow intake of SMS messages. Judging by these two issues there seems to be enough issues to earn 1000 points as there are many SMS messages that we would have to test to see if they work.


H.) No issues can be confirmed

I.) The code itself seems pretty organized, things are seperated in an organized way such as SMS commands, storage, and tests. If i had to send a screenshot of the code to someone else id probably send the code within the command files. This code can be looked at and understood how the app takes an SMS and performs the command texted.

J.) There doesnt seem to be a Junit test but instead one big test that tests the application as a whole. That being said there can be tests testing each command.
